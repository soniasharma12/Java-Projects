	Interactive Assignment
	Feb. 16th, 2021
	Description: This interactive assignment is for the user to interact with the computer by answering a simple series of questions
    			(i.e. what's your favorite colour, etc).
    This assignment demonstrates my understanding of incorporating variables, data-types & operators, using Math class for complex calculations,
    get user inputs via Scanner class, concatenation, use of comments, & using logic to program and provide a given output.
